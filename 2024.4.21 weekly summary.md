I have not achieve any of the goals I set for myself on Apirl 12, but May is still ahead, giving me another chance to accmplish them.

This week, I did not dedicate enough time to reciteing IELTS vocabulary. I need to make better use of my free time for this purpose.

I made a decision that I will pratice acm and ctf during class time and focus on leaning learn major subjects in the evening.

I have noticed that I have been spending a lot of time chatting online lately. I must break this habit.
